    "\n",
    "The project aims to analyse mental health awareness and support in the tech industry across varied organisation sizes, e.g. small, medium and large via a limited but comprehensive sample set. By examining the responses on specific rows, such as mental health treatment plan, family history, company-provided benefits along with work place dynamics - the study seeks to identify how company size and demographic factors influence whether an employee feels comfort in discussing their mental health. These insights may aid in informing workplace policies by reducing stigma or through promoting support systems in tech environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective 1 (Yuchen Sun): Clean and process the limited data sample set, adressing missing values, inconsistencies in column specific areas, e.g. gender and age - in addition to dicussing the accuracy of the data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective 2 (Xiao Tan): Identify and visualize trends on mental health openness along with support across various company sizes, focusing on whether these trends differ by age, gender or by company type. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective 3 (Yuanlin Zhou): Train and evaluate classification models, e.g. KNN and logistic regression - to predict whether an employee are likely to seek mental health treatment based on specific features, e.g. work environment, demographic details, company support. The evaluation stage involves analysing the model's accuracy and precision to determine its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objective 4 (Stephen McGuinness): To aid in report writing and acting as the project's facilitator, e.g. ensuring individuals meet specific deadlines, version control etc. \n",

    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "![process](./image/process.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall architecture of the data process is illustrated in diagram. The process begins with identifying and solving outliers in the data. Next, the code applies feature engineering techniques to standardize gender labels and transform data where necessary. Following this, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted, where data characteristics are visualized using bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to gain insights. In the model training and evaluation phase, some machine learning models, like Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors, are trained on the preprocessed data. After completing the training, the models are evaluated based on accuracy. Finally, the results are displayed through visualization tools to help interpretation.\n",

    "### Processing Modules and Algorithms\n",

    "- Preprocess data: Fill missing values in \"self_employed\" and \"state\" columns with \"Unknown\" using Pandas.\n",
    "- Encode categorical variables: Use LabelEncoder from sklearn.preprocessing to convert categorical values into numeric values for model compatibility.\n",
    "- Model construction: Implement Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbors for data classification and analysis.\n"
